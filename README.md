# Reversi
A networked and local game of Reversi complete with AI<br>
The goal of this project is to practice the concepts I have learned in my computer science classes.<br>
Some of these include:
- Object-oriented programming design patterns
- Network-based programs
- GUI design and implementation

Eventually I plan to have a website where this project can be downloaded as an executable.
